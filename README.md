# Laravel 8 Files/Folders Management

This is a blank [Laravel](https://laravel.com) project that will connect to any prismic.io repository. It uses the prismic.io PHP development kit, and provides a few helpers to integrate with a Laravel website.

## Getting started

### Launch the starter project

_(Assuming you've [installed Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/installation))_

Fork this repository, then clone your fork, and run this in your newly created directory:

```bash
- Clone the repository with git clone
- composer install
```

Next you need to make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` inside your project root.

Run the following command to generate your app key:

```
php artisan key:generate
```
Run the following command to create table in database:

```
- php artisan migrate --seed - (it has some seeded data for your testing)
```
Run the following command to link storage to public:

```
- Run php artisan storage:link
```

Then start your server:

```
php artisan serve
```

Your Laravel starter project is now up and running!
